# RX8-Arduino
A modification of [RX8-Arduino](https://gitlab.com/christiangroleau/rx8-arduino/) by Christian Groleau.  This project allows you to control a Mazda RX8 instrument cluster with Forza Horizon 5 or Dirt Rally 2.0 through an Arduino.

## Overview
I have added a handbrake controlled via a momentary button and an Arduino Uno.  Future plans are to control the RPM Limiter beeper (upshift warning) and adding a button to dynamically switch between the two supported games.

For details about how to get started, use the above link to the original project.
